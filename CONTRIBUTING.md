# Contributing to Continuum

No ceremony. No rules. Just help.

1. Fork it.  
   `git clone https://github.com/Roshan65/Continuum.git`

2. Branch off main.  
   `git checkout -b add/stripe-node`

3. Code small.  
   - New activity? Put in `backend/src/main/kotlin/activities/`  
   - UI tweak? `frontend/extensions/workflow-canvas/`  
   - Don’t refactor the universe. Fix what’s in front of you.

4. Test locally.  
   Spin up Temporal, Kafka, MinIO. Run a flow. Make sure nothing explodes.

5. Commit clean.  
   `git commit -m "Add Stripe charge activity"`

6. Pull request.  
   Open to `main`.  
   Say what changed.  
   If it’s rough — I’ll say “rough”. We’ll polish.

Go ahead. No permission slip needed.

One ask: keep it readable.  
If I can’t follow it, no one can.

That’s it.
